Many Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) in Indonesia still don't use today's
technology and business are falling behind as a result. Information is now very widely spread
and the internet is now the cornerstone of consumer awareness, it is important for MSME to
adapt to today's marketing strategies to increase their sales so they will not fall irrelevant and
end in bankruptcy. For that reason we need to see various potential alternatives media to be
used as a media marketing.
